Regression Project for House Prices in USA
Overview
This project is a part of the Machine Learning course and aims to build a regression model to predict the prices of houses in the USA. The dataset used for this project is sourced from a publicly available dataset that contains information on various housing features such as the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and other related attributes.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The target variable is the sale price of each house.

Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the sale price of a house based on its features. We will perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve our goal.

Methodology
We will start by exploring the dataset and performing data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Next, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify any relationships between variables.

After this, we will perform feature engineering to create new variables that may improve the model's performance. We will then use various regression models such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression to train our model.

Finally, we will evaluate the model's performance on a holdout test set and tune the hyperparameters to achieve better results.

Conclusion
This project aims to build a regression model that can predict house prices in the USA based on various features. Through the various stages of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, we hope to achieve a model that can accurately predict house prices.
